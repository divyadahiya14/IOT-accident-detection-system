IoT-Based Accident Prevention & Driver Authentication System Overview With road accidents increasing at an alarming rate, accounting for a loss of approximately 3-5% of global GDP, this project focuses on reducing accidents and ensuring vehicle security. Using IoT-powered real-time monitoring, our system detects potential risks and alerts drivers before accidents occur. Additionally, it incorporates a driver authentication system using facial recognition with a driver's license to prevent unauthorized access.

Key Features ‚úÖ Real-Time Monitoring: Collects and analyzes data from multiple sensors to detect potential risks. ‚úÖ Accident Prevention: Alerts drivers in case of overheating, gas leaks, sudden impacts, or abnormal sounds. ‚úÖ Theft Protection: Uses facial recognition-based driver authentication to ensure only authorized users can access the vehicle. ‚úÖ Buzzer & Alarm Alerts: Generates alerts based on the magnitude of detected threats. ‚úÖ IoT-Based Integration: Uses ESP32 for sensor communication and real-time processing.

Hardware Components ESP32 (Microcontroller for IoT connectivity) Temperature Sensor (Detects overheating) Gas & Smoke Detector (Identifies gas leaks or fire hazards) Force Sensor (Detects collisions or sudden impacts) Sound Detector (Identifies unusual noises indicating accidents) Camera Module (For facial recognition-based driver authentication) Buzzer/Alarm (Alerts users in case of detected threats) Software & Technologies Arduino IDE (Microcontroller programming) Python & OpenCV (Facial recognition system) Firebase/Cloud Storage (Driver authentication data management) MQTT Protocol (IoT communication) How It Works 1Ô∏è‚É£ Sensors monitor vehicle conditions in real-time. 2Ô∏è‚É£ If a risk is detected (e.g., overheating, gas leak, impact), an alarm/buzzer is triggered. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Driver Authentication ensures only authorized users can start the vehicle using facial recognition with the driver's license. 4Ô∏è‚É£ The system logs data and alerts in case of unauthorized access or abnormal conditions.

Future Enhancements üöÄ AI-based predictive analysis for accident risk forecasting üöÄ Integration with emergency services for automatic alerting in case of accidents üöÄ GPS tracking for real-time location monitoring
